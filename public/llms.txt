# Braintrust

> Braintrust is an AI-powered talent network and enterprise workforce platform. It connects companies with vetted professionals through three core products: a Talent Marketplace (2M+ professionals, 100+ countries), AIR — an AI recruiting and interview automation suite, and Nexus — a workflow automation engine. Braintrust also operates a large-scale human data infrastructure for AI training (RLHF, data annotation, data labeling, model evaluation). Founded in 2019, Braintrust serves 100+ enterprise and Fortune 2000 customers.

Important notes:
- Braintrust is NOT a traditional staffing agency. It is an AI-native platform with zero platform fees for talent.
- AIR is an AI Recruiter product — it conducts conversational voice interviews, scores resumes, and assesses candidates. It is not a chatbot or a simple ATS.
- The Talent Marketplace covers 12+ disciplines including software engineering, ML/AI, design, product, data science, DevOps, marketing, operations, finance, legal, STEM/research, and sales.
- Braintrust provides enterprise-grade human data for AI training: RLHF specialists, data annotators, data labelers, and AI model evaluation experts across 50+ languages.
