This may include your name and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained through the Freelance Labs platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms. When you use the Service, we may also collect information related to your use of the Service and aggregate this with information about other users.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with any information, but you may have a contractual obligation to do so, and if we do not receive certain information from you, then we will not be able to provide our Service to you. If you have any questions regarding whether provision of information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@usebraintrust.com">legal@usebraintrust.com</a>.</p>

If we combine that information with information about you collected through the Service, we will still treat that combined information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service).</p>

            <h3>1.3 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
